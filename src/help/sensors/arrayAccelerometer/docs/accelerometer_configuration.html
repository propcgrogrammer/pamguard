<h1>Array Accelerometer Configuration</h1>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Creating an Array Accelerometer Module</h3>
<p>From the <strong><em>File>Add modules>Sensors</em></strong>
menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select <i>'Array
Accelerometer'</i>. Enter a name for the new module and press Ok.</p>

<p>The accelerometer module is not dependent on any other modules
and will automatically find and exchange information with the <a
	href="../../../utilities/hydrophoneArrayManagerHelp/docs/Array_Overview.html">
Hydrophone Array Manager</a>.</p> 

<h3>Configuring an Array Accelerometer Module</h3>
<p>Go to <strong><em>Settings>Array Accelerometer...</em></strong> 
and the following dialog will appear.</p>
<br>
<img alt="Accelerometer side panel" src="images/ArrayAccelConfig.png" />
<br>
<p>The dialog is divided into three sections</p>
<h4>MCC Device</h4>
<p>In this section you will find a drop down list of installed MeasurementComputing devices. If
you can't see your device here, refer to the MCC documentation on how to install it</p>
<p>Select the smallest voltage range that can cover the range out output values expected from the 
sensor (generally +/- 2V)</p>

<h4>Readout</h4>
<p>Enter the readout interval in seconds. The accelerometer should not be read at a rate > once per second.</p>
<p>Select the channels of the MCC device which you wish to read for each of the x,y and z accelerometers.</p>
<p>Roll is measured from the x and z accelerometers, Pitch is measured from all three. If you only wish 
to read roll, there is no need to read out the y axis, in which case you can enter -1 for this channel 
number.</p> 

<h4>Calibration</h4>
<p>Enter the calibration values for each channel. Generally the Zero offset voltage is half the power supply voltage 
and the scales (Volts per g) should be the values from the accelerometer data sheet.</p>
<p>With the accelerometer on the horizontal, it is possible to automatically set the zero offsets by pressing 
the 'Set Zeros' button.</p>
<p>If the module has not been mounted square within the hydrophone frame, you may also enter offset values which 
will be added to the measured pitch and roll</p>
