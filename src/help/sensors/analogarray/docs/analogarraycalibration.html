<h2>Calibration</h2>


<p>Go to <strong><em>Settings>Analog Array Sensor Settings...</em></strong> 
and click on the calibration tab.</p>

<br>
	<p>For each channel enter calibration constants which will convert the measured voltage or current into a Depth, 
	 Pitch, Roll or Heading. These all follow a simple linear formula:</p>
	<p>Depth (or heading, or pitch or roll) = (measured value + constant 1) * constant 2 + constant 3</p>
	<p>There is some redundancy in this formula, but this is intended to make it easier to enter 
	the correct calibration values. For example, if you were using a 4 - 20mA depth sensor which had a nominal 
	maximum depth of 100m, the values would be calculated as follows:</p>
	<p>The first value is simply the 4mA offset on the reading, so set it to -0.04</p>
	<p>The second value is the range of the sensor (100m) divided by the range of the input device (16mA) so 
	set it to 100/0.016 = 6250.0.</p>
	<p>The third value can be left at zero</p>
	<p>Now consider the consequences of finding that there is a 3.2m offset in the depth readings. You could recalculate
	the first two constants, which would become -0.0045 and 6250. Much more simple will be to adjust the third parameter
	by the measured offset, leaving the first two alone, i.e. the three parameters become 
	  -.004, 6250 and 3.2.</p>
