	<h1>Time Display FX</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<br>

	<p>The Time Display FX is a general and flexible display for
		displaying time based data from multiple sound processing and
		detection modules.</p>
	<p>The display uses the Java FX graphics library which is only
		available if you are running Java version 8 or above (i.e. not Java
		7).</p>
	<p>Time is always displayed along one axis of the display, the
		units of the other axis can vary depending on the type of data, for
		instance, click detector output can contain bearing, inter-click
		interval, amplitude or frequency information, whereas FFT output can
		only display frequency information.</p>

	<p>Types of data which can be shown on this display are shown in
		the table below:</p>

	<h3>Configuring the display</h3>
	<p>
		Any number of Time Displays can be created within PAMGuard <a
			href="../../../displays/userDisplayHelp/docs/userDisplayPanel.html">User
			Display Panels.</a>
	</p>
	<p>Once a User Display Panel has been created, the option to create
		a "New time base display fx" will appear in the User Display menu.
		Select this menu option and an empty display container will appear.</p>
	<br>

	</center>
	<br>
	<p>Click on the downward poining arrow 'V' in the middle near the
		top of the display to show the display configuration panel.</p>
	<br>
	<center>
		<img src="./images/emptydisplayconfig.png" alt="">
	</center>
	<br>
	<h3>Graphs and Data</h3>
	<p>To configure the display the user must understand the concept of
		"Graphs"</p>
	<p>A display panel can contain any number of graphs, with each one
		being stacked vertically in the display. All graphs within a display
		panel will share a common time axis and time scroll bar, however each
		graph can have a different data axis dimension (e.g. bearing,
		frequency, amplitude, etc.)</p>
	<p>The data axis dimension is controlled by the type of data added
		to each graph.</p>
	<p>To add or remove graphs, use the + and - buttons at the left end
		of the configuration panel</p>
	<br>
	<center>
		<img src="./images/addgraph.png" alt="">
	</center>
	<br>
	<p>Add data to a graph by clicking on the Graph buttons in the
		configuration panel to show a drop down menu of available data types
		(if no data are available, then add some modules to your PAMGuard
		configuration). Data can be removed from a graph using the same menus.</p>
	<br>
	<center>
		<img src="./images/adddata.png" alt="">
	</center>
	<br>
	<p>You can add as many types of data to a graph as you wish and the
		data will be plotted on top of one another. There are no constraints
		as to which data are mixed within a graph, but the user should select
		data which can be plotted on a common axis, i.e. it's not sensible to
		select one type of data which can only display frequency and another
		which can only display amplitude.</p>

	<h3>Axis Dimensions</h3>
	<p>Once data have been added to a graph, the display will examine
		each type of data to see which data dimensions it supports and
		construct a list of possible dimensions from all types of data
		connected to that graph. To select the dimension of the display axis,
		click on the small > arrow in the top left corner of a graph and a
		larger panel will appear showing all possible options.</p>
	<br>
	<center>
		<img align="top" hspace="10" src="./images/axisbutton.png" alt=""><img
			align="top" src="./images/axiscontrol.png" alt="">
	</center>
	<br>
	<p>In this case, the graph is showing both Spectrogram data (FFT
		2kHz) and the output of a Whistle and Moan detector (Moans Contours).
		The Spectrogram data can show only on a Frequency axis, whereas the
		moans can show either on a frequency or on a bearing axis. Therefore
		if the frequency axis is selected, both the spectrogram AND the Moans
		Contours will show, however if the bearing axis is selected, then only
		the Moans will show.</p>
	<p>Also note that the display has discovered that the FFT data is
		multi-channel (channels 0 and 7 in this case) and additional options
		have been provided to display only certain channels of data. Different
		channels are displayed within separate display strips within each
		graph.</p>

	<h3>Scrolling</h3>
	<p>
		<img class="wrap" hspace="10" src="./images/scrollwrap.png" alt="">
		When running in real time mode, the display can operate in "Scroll" or
		"Wrap" mode. Toggle between the two modes using the button with left /
		right arrows in the configuration panel. Scrolling often looks nicer,
		but if you're trying to mark data in real time, wrapping can often be
		easier since things are moving around less.
	</p>

	<h3>Data Marking</h3>
	<p>
		<img class="wrap" hspace="10" src="./images/allowmarking.png" alt="">
		To mark data on the display, select the "Allow marking" button in the
		configuration panel. To make and use data marking, you will also need
		to correctly configure the relationship between the display and marked
		data and will have to hold down the Ctrl while making marks. For more
		information see <a href="../../displaymarks/docs/displaymarks.html">Display
			Marking</a>. The display will pause while marks are being drawn.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Data Display Options</h3>
	<p>Many types of data have a number of options controlling how they are displayed, for instance the colour used
	for symbols, amplitude ranges of spectrograms, etc.</p>
	<p>Configuration panels for individual data types are available by clicking on the settings button in the
	top right corner of each graph. The example below shows settings panels for a graph showing 
	Spectrogram and Whistle and Moan Detector data. For the spectrogram, the user can select the frequency range 
	to display and the amplitude colour and scale. For the 'moans' it is possible to select a symbol type and colour.</p>
