	<h1>Data and Symbol Selection</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
		PAMGuard contains powerful methods for choosing which data to display,
		and which symbols should be used to display it. This is achieved using
		<a href="dataselection.html">Data Selectors</a> and <a
			href="symbolchoice.html">Symbol Choosers</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Data properties are often quite different for the various
		PAMGuard detectors, so different options are available which reflect
		what is appropriate for each type of data. Increasingly, data may be
		grouped into 'Events' or 'Super Detections' in which case data may
		also be selected or coloured by the properties of those groupings.
		Further, PAMGuard is increasingly using annotations, for instance
		allowing the user to develop their own form to add information to a
		spectrogram mark. Again it is possible for the user to select and
		colour based on the content of these annotations.</p>

	<p>Data selector and symbol chooser options are usually accessed by
		clicking on the display with the right mouse button and selecting the
		small wheel like icon on the popup menu items.</p>

	<p>
		As well as being different for each type of data, PAMGuard also
		creates a unique data selector and symbol chooser for each display.
		This means that you can select one subset of data on one display, and
		a different type of data on another. For example, you might chose to
		have two map displays, one showing clicks that have been classified as
		harbour porpoise and another map showing beaked whales. Similarly, you
		might have a display of clips from the <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/ClipGenerator/docs/ClipGenerator.html">clip
			generator</a> which shows all of the clips, and a second display which
		only shows those that have been included in a <a
			href="../../../localisation/detectiongroup/docs/dglocaliser.html">group
			detection</a>. <br>
