	<h1>Database</h1>
	<h2>SQLite Databases</h2>

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> is a single file database
		and is an excellent replacement for Microsoft Access. Data are stored
		in a single file which can easily be backed up and copied between
		computers.
	</p>
	<p>
	SQLite is cross platform so should work on Mac's and Linux platforms as well as Windows. 
	</p>
	<p>
		SQLite is open source and free to use. A number of viewers are
		available to enable you to view data directly within the database
		file. We have tested and recommend SQLiteStudio which can be
		downloaded <a href="http://sqlitestudio.pl/">here</a>.

		automatically create the tables it needs.</p>
