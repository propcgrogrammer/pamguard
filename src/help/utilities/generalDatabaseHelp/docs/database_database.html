	<h1>Database</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>PAMGuard stores data from many modules in a database. The
		database not only stores detector output, but also detector
		configuration and settings so that it will effectively form a single
		document at the end of the cruise, detailing how PAMGuard was set up
		and what was detected.</p>
	<h3>Adding a database module</h3>
	<p>
		From the <strong><em>File>Add Modules>Utilities</em></strong> menu
		select <i>'Database'</i> to add a database to your configuration.
	</p>
	<h3>Configuring the database</h3>
	<p>
		PAMGuard can use either MySQL or SQLite databases. Support for
		Microsoft Access databases has been removed with the upgrade from Java
		7 to Java 8. <a href="import_export.html">See here</a> for information
		on how to convert old Access databases to one of the supported
		formats.
	</p>
	<p>The setup for each databases type is slightly different, but
		operation and integration into the rest of PAMGuard is the same.</p>
	<p>
		To configure the database, go to the <strong><em>File>Database
				Selection...</em></strong> menu to open the Database Selection dialog. At the top
		of the dialog, select either MySQL, Microsoft Access or OpenOffice
		from the drop down list. Then refer to specific instructions for each
		database type below.

	<h3>Choosing a database system</h3>
	<p>Which database system you use is largely a matter of personal
		choice.</p>
	<p>
		An excellent article on the advantages and disadvantages of SQLite and
		MySQL is available <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Basically, SQLite is a single file database (rather like MS
		Access) which can easily be backed up and copied between machines just
		like any other data file. MySQL is a server based database which is
		much harder to move between computers but can better handle multiple
		users accessing the same data simultaneously. So if you're in the
		field collecting data on a laptop, you're almost definitely better off
		with SQLite. On the other hand, if you have the technical know how and
		want a managed database system back at the lab, you might consider
		MySQL as a solution.</p>
	<p>
		The latest PAMGuard versions contain excellent facilities for <a
			href=import_export.html>moving data between different database
			systems</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Adding tables to the database</h3>
	<p>PAMGuard will automatically add the necessary tables to your
		database.</p>
	<p>If a new detector module is added to PAMGuard at any point, the
		database module is notified and will add the additional tables
		required.</p>
	<p>If a module is removed and a table is no longer needed, that
		table will be left in the database unaltered.</p>
	<p>Should the definition of a table change due to the new release
		of a module which outputs additional information, any additional
		columns required will be automatically added to existing tables.</p>

	<h3>Other alterations</h3>
	<p>You may add other tables and queries to the database without
		affecting PAMGuard operation. Additional tables will be ignored by
		PAMGuard.</p>
	<p>You can even add additional columns to tables which are used by
		PAMGuard and these additional columns will also be ignored.</p>
	<p>However, you should not change the format of any existing
		columns and do not create relationships between tables which may not
		always be satisfied or PAMGuard may be unable to write data to the
		database.</p>
