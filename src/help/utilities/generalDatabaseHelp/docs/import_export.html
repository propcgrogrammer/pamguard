	<h1>Database</h1>
	<h2>Importing and Exporting from other Databases</h2>

	<p>In Viewer Mode, database tables can be imported or exported from
		the current PAMGuard database to and from external databases. This
		feature can be used to copy an entire database (for example, you may
		need to import and old Microsoft Access database into the newer SQLite
		database format) or you could copy data for an subset of tables (for
		example, import the UDF_ logger forms definitions from another
		database).</p>
	<p>Currently, in order to avoid duplicating data, it is only
		possible to copy entire database tables into entirely empty database
		tables. If you wish to transfer data into a table which already
		contains data, you will be prompted to delete and recreate that
		table prior to importing / exporting data.</p>
	<p>
		To export or import data, select one of the <strong><em>File>Database>External>Export
				to database </em></strong> or <em><strong>Import from database</em></strong> menu
		items.
	</p>
	<p>You will then be presented with the database selection dialog
		where you chose the database you want to exchange data with.
	</p>
	<p>Once you select a database, you will see the Import / Export
		dialog where you can chose which tables to copy between the two
		databases. (There may be a short delay while PAMGuard analyses the
		external database).</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<p>If you are transferring data to a new blank database, then it's
		likely that most of the destination tables will show an Error. Hover
		the mouse over the buttons to see the error. Most likely it's simply
		that the tables need creating. Press the "Create" button near the top
		of the screen and the errors will disappear. If tables already contain
		data, they will be flagged as "Warning". Again, hover the mouse over
		each button to see what's wrong. Click the button for a menu of
		possible actions to fix any problems (generally dropping and
		recreating tables).</p>
	<p>Select the tables you wish to export / import and press "Start".
	</p>
	<p>If you are importing data, at the end of the import process, by
		default, PAMGuard will load the latest configuration from the imported
		configuration tables. Un-check the box if you do not want this to
		happen.</p>
		
	<h3>Indexing and Cross Referencing</h3>
	<p>Every PAMGuard database table has an indexed column named "Id".
		This number is automatically generated as data are written to the
		table and may therefore change when data are copied between databases.
	</p>
	<p>For simple data, where the original data were written by
		PAMGuard and nothing was deleted, then it's likely that the Id's will
		be the same. However, for data which have been manipulated either by
		someone messing with the database or by data being added / deleted in
		the Viewer, then it's likely that the copied data will have different
		Id's</p>
	<p>To keep track of data, each copied database table will contain
		an additional column with the name "CopyId". This will contain the Id
		of the data in the table it was copied from.</p>
	<p>For most data this is not a problem. However, Click Detector
		events marked in the PAMGuard Viewer populate two database tables one
		of which cross references to the other. With the possible change of
		Id's, these cross references may no longer be correct. PAMGuard will
		automatically correct these altered cross references.</p>
		<p>Otherwise, you will only ever be aware of these Id changes should you have
		referred to an event by it's Id - e.g. if you emailed a colleague and event number to 
		check over.</p>
