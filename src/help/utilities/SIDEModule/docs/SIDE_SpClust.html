    <h2>Species Cluster Selection</h2>
    <h3><a name="spClust">Species Cluster</a></h3>
    <p>
        The Species Clusters panel allows the user to specify which species to test for.

    <p>
        Species are selected by checking the box next to their name, under the
        type of test desired. For descriptions of the Quick Test and Random
        Drill Test, please see <a href="SIDE_Overview.html#tests">the
        Overview</a> page. The selected clusters should match the species for
        which you intend to monitor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="range">The</a> <strong><em>Nominal Range</em></strong> value is
        the minimum detection range for the species. This is used as the mean
        distance from the receiver for generated signals, and would typically
        equal your exclusion zone for that cluster. Signals will be injected
        both inside and outside the Nominal Range using the <strong><em>Test
        Range Limits</em></strong> (see below) as a modifier.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Test Range Limits</h3>
    <p>
        The Test Range Limits window allows the user to specify the dispersion of the generated sounds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Species sounds are randomly distributed between the minimum distance
        (<sup><em>Nominal Range</em></sup>/<sub><em>Range Factor</em></sub>)
        and the maximum distance
        (<em>Nominal Range</em> &#215; <em>Range Factor</em>). To minimize
        sequences injected at very close and very far ranges, edit the factor to
        2. To increase the sequences that are injected at very close and very
        far ranges, increase the factor above 4
