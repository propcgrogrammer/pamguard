    <h1>SIDE Module</h1>
    <h2>Operations Status</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        The Operations Status window allows the user to specify and log the
        current operating conditions or monitoring phase. Test statistics will
        be collected separately for each state. <strong>Critical
        Monitoring</strong> and <strong>Non-Critical Monitoring</strong>
        statuses are included by default. The Critical Monitoring state is
        intended for periods of active mitigation monitoring, while the
        Non-Critical Monitoring state is intended for periods of monitoring that
        are not required for compliance or prior to a critical monitoring period.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is recommended that Quick Tests be performed during non-critical
        monitoring when possible. Random Drills can be implemented and edited
        throughout monitoring periods.

        The current operations status can be selected from the drop-down text
        box. In order to properly log a status change to the database, a
        selection must be made from the text box <em>even if the correct status is
        already displayed</em>. When a status is selected, it will be shown in
        the <a href="SIDE_InfoTables.html#opState">Operations State</a> table in the middle of the SIDE Module
        display, along with a time stamp to indicate when the status was
        changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pressing the <strong><em>Edit</em></strong> button will allow the user
        to add custom operational status codes. For example, noise conditions
        may vary considerably when seismic shooting and not shooting, so it may
        be sensible to have separate statuses for each of those conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may also be desirable to avoid Random Drill tests during certain
        'Critical Monitoring' periods such as immediately prior to line start.
        Random Drill tests can therefore be allowed or disabled for specific
        operations states by checking or unchecking the appropriate box.
