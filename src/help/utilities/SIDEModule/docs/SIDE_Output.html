    <h1>SIDE Module</h1>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
      The SIDE Module saves information to the database, and can also generate summary reports for later review.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Database</h3>
    <p>
      Three linked tables are generated in the PAMGuard database:
      <ul>
         <li>SIDE_Sounds lists every sound injected</li>
         <li>SIDE_Sequences lists every sequence</li>
         <li>SIDE_Tests lists every test</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each record in the sounds table cross references back to a record in the
      sequences table and each record in the sequences table cross references
      back to the tests table. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Summary Report</h3>
    <p>
      Detection Efficiency Reports (DER) can be generated at any time after a
      test by right-clicking on one or more tests listed in the PAMGuard
      <a href="SIDE_InfoTables.html#TestHistory">Test History Information
      Table</a> and selecting <strong><em>Process Test</em></strong> from the
      drop down menu. The operator can choose whether to show results for both
      sounds and sequences, or sequences only. Detection efficiency of separate
      detectors can be displayed on a single plot (if there are not too many
      detectors) or on separate plots (for multiple detectors).
    </p>
    <p>
      A logistic regression will be conducted for each
      Species Cluster / detector (or human) combination and a report
      automatically generated as a Microsoft Word document. The
      report provides several key outputs:
       <ul>
         <li>The report date and time and the version of PAMGuard used for monitoring</li>
         <li>System information including the hydrophone array configuration with details on hydrophone specifications, spacing, and tow position</li>
         <li>PAMGuard modules in operation during the monitoring</li>
         <li>A detection efficiency table for injected cluster signals showing
         range, the number of signals injected, the percentage of signals
         detected by the detectors, and where applicable, the number of signals
         detected by the operator</li>
         <li>A logistic regression plot for individual signal detection probability versus range</li>
         <li>A detection efficiency table and logistic regression plot for injected cluster sequences</li>
      </ul>
   </p>
    <p>
      The report provides information on detection range probabilities for each
      selected species cluster at both the signal and the sequence level. The
      logistic regression plots show the number of <em>hits</em> and
      <em>misses</em> for the automated detectors or the operator as well as the
      detection probability versus range. Additional information regarding the
      monitoring period and signal parameters are included in the efficiency
      report for each cluster.
