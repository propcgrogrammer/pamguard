    <h1>SIDE Module</h1>
    <h2>Quick / Random Drill Test Parameters</h2>
    <p>
        For descriptions of the Quick Test and Random
        Drill Tests, please see <a href="SIDE_Overview.html#tests">the
        Overview</a> page.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Quick test</h3>
    <img alt="" src="images/SIDEQuick.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The <strong><em>Number of Sequences</em></strong> defines how many <a
        href="SIDE_Overview.html#seq">sequences</a> the SIDE Module will
        generate for each of the species checked off under <em>Quick</em>
        in the <a href="SIDE_SpClust.html#spClust">Species Cluster</a> window.
        20 sequences are a recommended minimum to complete a Quick Test. A
        20-sequence Quick Test with all species clusters should take
        approximately 15 minutes to complete. If you have enough time, 40
        sequences will provide you with more accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pressing the <strong><em>Run Quick Tests</em></strong> button starts the Quick Test
        process. Note that this button is disabled (as shown in the image above)
        until all of the following conditions are met
        <ul>
            <li>PAMGuard processing has begun</li>
            <li>At least one species has been selected for a Quick Test in the <em>Species Clusters</em> window</li>
            <li>A Quick Test is not already running</li>
            <li>PAMGuard is not in Viewer mode</li>
            <li>An <a href="SIDE_OpStat.html">Operations Status</a> has been selected.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Poor results (e.g. poor regressions or all misses) likely indicate
        system or noise issues. Rather than increase the number of sequences
        injected in the hopes that a more accurate measure will yield better
        results, those issues should be investigated and solved first. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Checking the <strong><em>Auto generate report</em></strong> box will
        cause a report to immediately be created upon completion of the Quick
        Test. If this box is left unchecked, a report can be generated any time
        after a test by simply right-clicking on one or more tests listed in the
        PAMGuard <a href="SIDE_InfoTables.html#TestHistory">Test History
        Information Table</a> and selecting <strong><em>Process Test
        ##</em></strong> from the drop down menu. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Random Drill Tests</h3>
    <img alt="" src="images/SIDEDrill.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The <strong><em>Random Drill Interval</em></strong> defines the average
        amount of time (in minutes) between injected sounds. Actual elapsed time
        between sounds will be randomly distributed around this number. The
        injection period may be adjusted depending on the monitoring phase. The
        following <em>minimum</em> intervals are recommended to reduce the
        frequency of injections:
        <ul>
            <li>60 minutes for 3-5 species clusters</li>
            <li>120 minutes for > 5 species clusters</li>
        </ul>
