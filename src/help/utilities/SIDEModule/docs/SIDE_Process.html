    <h1>SIDE Module</h1>
    <h2>Workflow</h2>
    <p>
        There are two different workflows, depending on whether a Quick Test or
        a Random Drill is being run. Descriptions of each test can be found in
        the <a href="SIDE_Overview.html#tests">Overview</a>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Quick Test</h3>
    <p>
        The goal of a Quick Test is to determine the detection functionality of
        the PAM system in the current environmental conditions. The test is not
        intended to evaluate operator performance, but primarily to evaluate the
        efficacy of the automated detectors. Therefore, once started, the
        operator simply needs to wait until the Quick Test is complete. No
        further interaction is required.
    </p>
    <p>
        Detection matching takes place in real time, with the SIDE module
        monitoring data coming from each detector and matching the simulated
        sounds with the detections. A match between an injected signal
        and detection is counted if there is overlap in time and frequency of
        the simulated sounds and the detection. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A summary report can be immediately generated for operator review once the
        Quick Test has completed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Random Drill</h3>
    <p>
        Random Drills are intended to test both operator alertness and automated
        detector efficiency over much longer periods of time and different noise
        conditions. Sequences are injected into the audio stream like the Quick
        Test, but at an infrequent rate (every few hours) over a period of days
        or even weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The operator has three different methods to indicate that they have
        detected a sound.
        <ol>
           <li>They can draw an annotation box around the signal in the spectrgoram</li>
           <li>They can hit the <EM>Print Screen</EM> button in the top-left corner of the PAMGuard window</li>
           <li>They can click a <EM>Things Heard</EM> button if they have an Aural Listening Form module loaded</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of an annotation box, a match between an injected signal and an
        operator detection is counted if there is an overlap in time and
        frequency of the simulated sound and the annotation box. For the <em>Print
        Screen</em> and <em>Things Heard</em> buttons, it is likely that the
        operator will have pressed the button at some time after the sound first
        becomes visible on the display. For these annotation types therefore, a
        match is considered good if the button was pressed within 30s of the
        sound reaching the hydrophones. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Automated detectors are evaluated the same as in the Quick Tests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over an extended period of time Random Drills will generate the same
        statistics as the quick tests, but are more likely to capture the full
        range of operational (noise) conditions and operator attentiveness.
