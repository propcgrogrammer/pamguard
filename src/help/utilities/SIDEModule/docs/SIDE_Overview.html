    <title>SIDE Module Overview</title>

    <h1>SIDE Module</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Signal Injection and Detection Evaluator (SIDE) Module offers the
        ability to predict detection efficacy and document real-time automated
        detector and human operator effectiveness as a function of distance (range)
        between a detector and the sound source. Incorporating the SIDE module
        into PAMGuard will improve the scientific validity of any monitoring and
        mitigation regimes that use PAM as part of their suite of survey methods.
        It will serve as a toolkit for performance monitoring on both
        commercial and non-commercial projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is hoped that the integration of the SIDE module into PAMGuard will
        increase the pace of acceptance of PAM methodologies by regulatory
        authorities, by allowing an objective evaluation metric for critical
        assessment of in situ detection performance within specified monitoring
        distances and proposed PAM programs. In addition, the ability to
        automatically generate summary evaluation statistics in a standardized
        format will support and encourage the development and adoption of PAM
        standards throughout the industry. Importantly, use of SIDE will allow
        the efficacy and quality of different PAM operations to be objectively
        evaluated by non-specialists, and to allow operators to test the system
        themselves.

    <h3>Clusters, Signals, and Sequences</h3>
    <h4><a name="clusters">Species Clusters</a></h4>
    <p>
        There are over 70 species of marine mammals, and it is impossible to
        define a set of test signals for every one of those species. However,
        groups of related species often share similar signal properties.  This
        has led to the definition of a set of <em>species clusters</em> for the
        SIDE module. A species cluster is defined as a group of marine mammal
        species that share similar acoustic signal characteristics. Each species
        cluster is associated with a specific default call type that is expected
        to occur over a particular frequency bandwidth, over a range of source
        levels (i.e. <em>loudness</em>), and with a particular structure (pulsive,
        tonal, frequency sweep, etc.) and repetition rate. There are 9 different
        species clusters in the SIDE modules that the operator can test with:

    <h4><a name="sig">Signals</a></h4>
    <p>
        A signal is defined as a discrete vocalization that has a specific
        duration, frequency range, amplitude and depth as described in the table
        above. Using these parameters, individual signals are generated and
        displayed in PAMGuard spectrograms.
    </p>
    <p>
        A synthetic signal detection should not result in an unnecessary
        mitigation event during application of the SIDE module in a commercial
        survey. Therefore, the signal generation algorithm uses only key
        characteristics of the signal necessary to trigger automated detections.
        The simplified signals are suitable for use with the PAMGuard detectors,
        which are generally looking for quite a broad range of sound types.
        Operators should be able to recognize signals from background noise, but
        not mistake them for actual marine mammal vocalizations. They are
        <em>not</em> suitable for use with species-specific classifiers (e.g.
        the Rocca module, or Whistle classifier), which will reject them as
        unknown or make a random classification.
    </p>
    <p>
        Synthetic dolphin whistles are shown in the image below.

    <br>
    <h4><a name="seq">Sequences</a></h4>
    <p>
        With the exception of some baleen whales, few cetaceans will make just
        one call over the course of a minute. In practice, PAM systems often
        make detection decisions based on an entire call sequence, rather than
        by individual signals. A sequence is therefore defined as a series of
        signals that are associated with one another in the call repertoire of
        the species cluster. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The SIDE module generates sequences in a manner relevant to how both
        automatic detectors and humans make detection decisions. The module
        randomly varies the number of individual calls in a sequence, however
        the mean number of signals per sequence for each species cluster remains
        consistent. As with the individual synthetic sounds, the intent was not
        to generate a series of sounds that represent the actual vocal output of
        an animal but to generate enough signal for a detector or alert an
        operator to determine that an animal is present. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="tests">Tests</a></h3>
    <p>
        A Test is defined as a collection of rapidly injected sequences for each
        cluster to answer the question <em>Can my system detect calls from a
        number of species clusters at specified distances, under the current
        noise conditions?</em> In order to achieve this, a number of sequences of
        sounds are generated and injected into the current audio stream. The
        testing algorithm performs the following series of steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Randomly generates a time to produce a sequence of
            signals</li>
            <li>Generates a range, depth, and bearing of a source. The
            detection range of interest (generally the radius of the mitigation
            zone) and randomization factor can be set by the operator in the <a
            href="SIDE_SpClust.html#range">Species Cluster</a> settings
            panel</li>
            <li>Selects the number of sequences to generate based on
            parameters provided by the species cluster (see table above). </li>
            <li>Synthesizes individual signals representative of the
            bandwidth and temporal structure specified for that
            particular species cluster (see table above). </li>
            <li>Scales the signals according to the expected received level
            implied by the source slant range, source level distribution, and
            propagation law.</li>
            <li>Inserts the appropriately scaled and time-delayed synthesized
            sequences into multi-channel real-time (or archived data being
            streamed in real-time) data streams. Accurate time delays are
            essential since they allow PAMGuard modules to accurately localize
            the signals. This is important since operators, and some detectors,
            often use the regularity of multiple calls being detected on a
            consistent bearing to confirm a detection.</li>

        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Two types of test are available, a Quick Test (QT) and a Random Test
        (Drill). Both operate in almost exactly the same say and generate similar
        output, but serve slightly different purposes. 

    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Quick Test</h4>
    <p>
        The goal of a Quick Test is to determine the detection functionality of
        the PAM system in the current environmental conditions. The test is not
        intended to evaluate operator performance, but primarily to evaluate the
        efficacy of the automated detectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sequences are run one after the other with little or no delay, in
        order to generate sufficient data for evaluation in the shortest
        possible amount of time. In the image below, the generated signals of a
        Quick Test are shown as blue highlighted contours.
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="images/SIDEQuickTest.png">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Detection matching takes place in real time, with the SIDE module
        monitoring data coming from each detector and matching the simulated
        sounds with the detections. Since a precise time of detection is
        available for automatic detections, a match between an injected signal
        and detection is counted if there is overlap in time and frequency of
        the simulated sounds (allowing for appropriate propagation time delays)
        and the detection. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Quick Tests can be particularly useful at the start of a PAM operation
        to determine how well the system is operating under the current noise
        conditions.  This could lead to reconfiguration of the detectors or changes to the
        hydrophone deployment in order to improve detection efficiency
        (confirmed by further quick tests) before operations start in earnest.
        Quick Tests can be repeated whenever conditions change and detector
        efficacy is in question.
    </p>
    <br>
     <h4>Random Drill</h4>
    <p>
        Random Drills are intended to test both operator alertness and automated
        detector efficiency over much longer periods of time and different noise
        conditions. Sequences are injected into the audio stream like the Quick
        Test, but at an infrequent rate (every few hours) over a period of days
        or even weeks.
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="images/SIDERandDrill.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Over an extended period of time Random Drills will generate the same
        statistics as the quick tests, but are more likely to capture the full
        range of operational (noise) conditions and operator attentiveness.
