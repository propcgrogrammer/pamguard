    <h1>SIDE Module</h1>
    <h2>Reporting Matrix</h2>
    <p>
        The Reporting Matrix links species clusters with detectors, allowing the
        user to select which detectors they intend to use so that the SIDE
        module can log and assess the detector performance. If the sensitive
        bandwidth of a detector does not overlap with the bandwidth of a sound,
        then the selection box will be disabled. For each cluster the operator
        can select a primary detector, which will appear first in any reports.

    <p>
        It is the responsibility of the operator to determine which detectors
        (besides the primary) should be selected. Some may not be suitable for
        particular sound types, or not used by the operator. For example, if the
        operator typically annotates a spectrogram or hits print screen to
        record a detection but rarely clicks the <em>things I heard</em> button,
        then only the first two options would be selected. There is no detriment
        to activating all actions; however, it will require additional analysis
        on the operators part to assess detection performance by combining all
        the actions, and selecting irrelevant detectors will generate a very
        cluttered report.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SIDE module will only report the detection performance based on a
        single user action.
