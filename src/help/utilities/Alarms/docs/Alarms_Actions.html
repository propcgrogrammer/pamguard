<h1>Alarms Actions</h1>
<br><p>From the <a href="Alarms_Configuration.html">alarm configuration</a>
dialog, select the "Actions" tab to chose what will happen when an alarm fires. </p>

<br> 
<img alt="Alarm Actions" src="./images/AlarmActions2.png"/><br>
<br>
<p>Three alarm actions are currently available:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Playing a sound</p></li>
<li><p>Sending a message via a serial port</p></li>
<li><p>Sending an email via SMTP</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Additional alarm actions may be added in future releases</p>
<p><em>Data hold time</em> refers to the amount of time (in seconds) that each trigger of the alarm is held in internal memory.  Note the alarm triggers are stored immediately in
the database, and the value entered here does not affect that.  It will, however, affect how long the alarm is shown in the <a href="Alarms_Display.html">User Display Panel</a></p>
<br>

<h3>Play a sound</h3>
<p>Press the settings button to select the sound you want to play. Sounds will be 
played back over the default sound output device. Sounds should be in wav file format and 
can be anything you want - a beep or even a recorded voice message. </p> 
<br>

<h3>Serial Port Output</h3>
<p>This option outputs a string of data over a serial (COM) port. Note that the format of the 
strings may vary depending on the alarm trigger. </p>
<p>Note that if multiple alarms are used, all alarms will share a common serial port.</p>
<br>

<h3>Send Email</h3>
<p>Press the settings button to configure the SMTP email client.  The following window is displayed:</p>
<img alt="Email Parameters" src="./images/AlarmEmailParams.PNG"/><br><br>
<p>The values given for the Host and Port shown above are default for a Gmail account.</p>
<p>It is HIGHLY recommended that you create a new Gmail
account for this application, and <em>only</em> use that account for this application.  PAMGuard is open source software; as such, anyone with programming experience
and access to your computer could potentially step through the code and find the password associated with the email account. 
To minimize this risk, the password is not stored in the psfx file or within PAMGuard - you will be required to enter it every time you start PAMGuard or change the email settings.</p>
<p>Enter the email address of the account in the <em>Account Username</em> text box.</p>
<p>Enter the email address to send the email to in the <em>To Address</em> text box.</p>
<p>Enter the email address which will appear in the From field of the email, in the <em>From Address</em> text box.  Note that this is typically the same as what you
enter in the <em>Account Username</em> text box, but it does not have to be.</p>
<p>Check whether you want an email sent for an Amber alarm, a Red alarm, or both.</p>
