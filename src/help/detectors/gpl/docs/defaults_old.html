	<h1>Generalised Power Law Detector</h1>
	<h2>Default Settings</h2>
	<p>Default values for several species are available by clicking on the Set Defaults button.</p>

	<center><img alt="" src="images/defaults.png"></center>
	<br>

	<p>Note though that these default values were designed to work with specific sample rates, FFT lengths and FFT
		overlaps and
		you should adjust the <a href="../../../sound_processing/fftManagerHelp/docs/FFTEngine_Overview.html">FFT
			(Spectrogram) Engine</a> parameters accordingly, including a <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">Decimator module</a>
		if necessary to provide data at the right sample rate. Nominal values for these parameters are provided below.</p>
		<p>Key is to have about the right time and frequency resolution. The time resolution is the FFT Hop divided by the sample rate
		and the frequency resolution is the sample rate divided by the 
		FFT Length. This means that data with a sample rate of 
		2000 Hz, and FFT length of 2048 samples and an FFT hop of 128 samples will have time and frequency resolutions of 64ms
		and 0.98 Hz respectively. Exactly the same time and frequency resolutions could be achieved with data sampled at 1000Hz
		if you were to use an FFT length of 1024 samples and FFT hop of 64 samples. </p>
		<p>Note that PAMGuard does support FFT lengths which are not an exact power of 2, however such values may mean 
		that the FFT's are slow to computer which may impact on processing speed.</p>
