<h1>Click Detector</h1>
<h2>Click Detector Displays</h2>
<br>

<p>Data display and an interactive Graphical User Interface are
fundamental to the workings of the click detector. Clicks from many
species are often quite indistinct, especially when detected in noise
and at the limits of detectability. Visually, it is often easy for an
operator to pick out click trains on the display which consist of lines
of regularly spaced clicks on consistent, slowly changing bearings.</p>

<p>The click detector has a bespoke display panel containing a number
of different displays for looking both at click trains and at
individual clicks. It also displays information in the PAMGuard side
panel and can overlay information on the map and other standard
displays. </p>
