Click Detector
</h1><h2>Click Classification</h2>
<br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Individual clicks detected by the click detector can be
classified using one of two different click classifiers. The first, <a href="ClickDetector_basicClassification.html"> Basic click
Classifier</a> is the same as the click classifier in the IFAW
RainbowClick
software. The basic classifier is generally adequate for the
classification of high frequency harbour porpoise clicks and is
primarily retained for backwards compatibility with the RainbowClick
classifier. The second <a href="ClickDetector_betterClassification.html">Classifier
With Frequency Sweep</a> uses additional classification
parameters and is
more suitable for the detection of lower frequency odontocete clicks,
particularly those of beaked whales.</p>
<p>The classifier is set up from the <strong><em>Click
Detection&gt;Click Classification</em></strong>
menu.</p>

<h3>Click Classifier Selection</h3>
<p>Select the type of click classifier you wish to use from the
drop
down list. This will either be the <a href="ClickDetector_basicClassification.html"> Basic click
Classifier</a> or the <a href="ClickDetector_betterClassification.html">Classifier
With Frequency Sweep</a>.</p>
<p>You must also check the <i>'Run classification online'</i>
box if you
want clicks to be processed as they are detected.</p>
<p>You should check the <i>'Discard unclassified clicks'</i>
box if you
want clicks which do not pass any of the classification criteria to be
discarded. <strong>Use this feature with great caution and only
when you are confident that the classifiers are working well for the
clicks that you do want.</strong></p>
<h3>Click Types</h3>
<p>The click classification dialog contains a list of defined
click
types.</p>
<p>If more than one type is defined, then each click is tested
against each type in sequence and the click is classified as belonging
to the first type with a matching set of classification criteria.</p>
<p>If the click does not match the criteria of any of the
classifiers, then it is unclassified.</p>
<p>Use the New, Edit and Delete buttons to add, modify and remove
items from the list.</p>
<p>If an audible alarm has been associated with this click type,
checking/unchecking the alarm column will enable/disable it. Alarms can
be associated with click types in the Individual Click Classification
dialog (press the Edit button to open the dialog).</p>
<p>Each click is checked against the different click types in
sequence. As soon as one set of criteria is matched, the classifier
will
stop searching other click types. It is therefore sometimes important
to
arrange the different types in a particular order. Use the Up and Down
buttons to move different click types up and down in the list.</p>
<p>Individual species classifiers can be enabled or disabled, for
example if you wish to temporarily stop checking for a particular click
type.</p>
<p>Classified clicks can also be discarded. For example, if there
was a particular noise source causing false triggers of the click
detector (e.g. a depth sounder), it may be possible to set up a
classifier for those detections and immediately discard them.</p>
<p>If either the New or the Edit button is pressed, the
Individual
Click Classification dialog will be displayed. The behaviour of this
dialog will
depend on the type of classifier selected.</p>
