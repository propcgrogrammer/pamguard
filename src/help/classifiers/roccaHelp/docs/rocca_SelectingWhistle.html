<h1>ROCCA</h1>
<h2>Manually Selecting a Whistle</h2>
<br>
<p>To manually classify a whistle using ROCCA, the user must
first select the whistle from the scrolling spectrogram display. Move
the cursor to one corner of the whistle, press and hold the mouse
button while dragging the cursor to the opposite corner, and release
the button. A red box will be drawn around the selection, and the time
and frequency of the starting point (upper left corner) and ending
point (lower right corner) of the box are displayed in the ROCCA
sidebar for reference.</p>
<p></p>

<p>When the mouse button is released, a new window will be opened
containing that portion of the spectrogram selected by the user. The
new window is minimized automatically to allow the user to continue
selecting whistles from the scrolling spectrogram. The user does NOT
need to classify the whistle immediately. The number of captured
whistles is only limited by the amount of memory available on the
computer.</p>
<p>If an <a href="rocca_Sidebar.html">Encounter
Number</a> has not yet been specified, the user will be prompted
for one after the first whistle has been selected.</p>
