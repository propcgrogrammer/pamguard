<h1>ROCCA</h1>
<h2>ROCCA&nbsp;Sidebar</h2>
<br>
<p>ROCCA&nbsp;assembles the results of individual whistle
classifications
into groups as defined by the user. Each group must be given a name,
the <strong>Encounter Number</strong>. In addition to
classifying individual
whistle, ROCCA will also classify the Encounter Number
to species. This is known as the Encounter Classification and is
determined by either using the encounter classifier model (if loaded),
or summing the percentage of tree votes for each species over all of
the whistles/clicks in that Encounter Number and selecting the species
with the highest total.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Encounter number: the current encounter number. This is
the encounter number used when a whistle is selected from the
spectrogram display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scroll buttons: scroll through the list of encounter
numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classification
results: the individual classification tally for the current encounter
number. The list of possible species is based on the classifier model
currently loaded. The number beside the species name indicates the
number of whistles/clicks that have been <a href="rocca_WhistleSchoolClassification.html">classified</a>
as that species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encounter classification: the overall species <a href="rocca_WhistleSchoolClassification.html#SchoolClassification">classification</a>
for the current encounter number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encounter ID: text box allowing user to add notes to
contour output file. This text box is identical to the box found in the
<a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_Notes">ROCCA
parameters configuration</a> window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Known Species: text box allowing user to add notes to
contour output file. This text box is identical to the box found in the
<a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_Notes">ROCCA
parameters configuration</a> window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename
Encounter: allows the user to rename the current encounter. Any output
files previously
saved that use the old encounter number in the filename will be renamed
with the new encounter number. Note that the information <em>in</em>
the <a href="rocca_SavedFiles.html#contour">whistle
contour stats save file</a>
is NOT updated - the user must modify any references to the old
encounter number manually. Also note that the user will not be allowed
to duplicate encounter numbers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classify Encounter: classifies the encounter one of two
ways. &nbsp;If an Encounter Classifier model has been <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_SchoolClassifierModel">loaded</a>
and both whistle and click encounter stats have been <a href="rocca_Configure.html#SchoolStats">calculated</a>,
a random forest classifier is used to classify the encounter based on
the output of the whistle and click classifiers. If an Encounter
Classifier model has not been loaded, or if either the whistle or click
encounter stats are not being calculated, the encounter is classified
as the species with the highest cumulative percentage of votes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="SaveNow">Save Encounter</a>:
overwrites the current Encounter Stats file (as defined in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsOutput">ROCCA
Parameters window</a>) with the current list of encounters and
statistics. Encounter statistics are also automatically saved every 5
minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Encounter: create a new encounter number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whistle Start: lists the time and frequency of the first
user-selected point on the spectrogram</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whistle
End: lists the time and frequency of the second user-selected point on
the spectrogram. Note that once the second point is selected, the
portion of the spectrogram is captured in a new <a href="rocca_Spectrogram.html">popup</a> window.</p>
