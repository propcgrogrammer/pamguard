	<br>
	<p>You should always have deep learning models in their own folder.
		Do not have any additional jar files or other programming related
		things (like .dll files) in the same or sub folders. This has been
		known to cause issues with loading models which we have not got to the
		bottom of yet.</p>
	<p>Pytorch models must be saved using jit to be compatible with
		PAMGuard.</p>
	<p>Tensorflow models must be saved as .pb files to be opened in
		PAMGuard.</p>
