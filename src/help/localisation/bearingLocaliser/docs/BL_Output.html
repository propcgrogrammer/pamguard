        <p>Bearing localiser output for a Volumetric Array.  The chart shows the amplitude (represented by the colour) vs. Primary and Secondary angles.  The data for each
        point is averaged over all frequencies.</p>

        <p>The white line shows the amplitude as a function of Primary angle.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The plus sign indicates the point of highest gain.  This primary/secondary angle position is output as the bearing of the detection.</p>

        <p>Bearing localiser output for a Linear Array.  The chart shows the amplitude (represented by the colour) vs. Frequency and Primary angle.</p>

    <li>
        <p>The plus sign indicates the point along the line of highest gain.  This primary angle is saved as the bearing of the detection.</p>
