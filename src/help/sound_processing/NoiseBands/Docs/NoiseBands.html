	<h1>Noise Band Measurement</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<br>

	<p>This module allows you to measure noise is a multiple octave or third octave 
	frequency bands. These measurements are compatible with the ANSI Standard 
	<a href = "http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/standard/ansi/ASASTD.ANSI.ASA.S1.11">
	ANSI S1.11-2004 American National Standard Specification for
Octave-Band and Fractional-Octave-Band Analog and Digital Filters</a>.
	</p>
	<p>The method works by measuring noise in three third octave (or one octave) band in the highest octave 
	of the available data using a bank o fband pass filters. The data are then decimated
	 by a factor 2 and a further three third octave (or one octave)
	band measurements made in the highest octave of the decimated data. This process can be repeated for as many decimators /
	octaves of data that you wish, reaching lower and lower frequencies. Because the amount of raw data to be processed
	is halved in each decimator, each bank of filters requires increasingly less processing power. </p>

	<h3>Creating the module</h3>
	<p>
		From the <em><strong>File>Add modules>Sound Processing</strong></em>
		menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select "<em><strong>
				Noise Band Measurement</strong></em>". Enter a name for the new module and press Ok.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Configuring the module</h3>
	<p>
		To configure the module, open the settings dialog from the <em><strong>Detection>"your
				module name" </strong></em> menu:
	</p>
	<br>
	<img alt="Filters Settings" src="Images/NoiseBandDialog.png" />
	<br>
	<h4>Raw Data Source</h4>
	<p>
		Select a source of raw data. This will generally be a <a
			href="../../AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">
			Sound Acquisition Module</a> or the output of a <a
			href="../../decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">
			Decimator</a> if a lower frequency noise measurement is required. Check
		the channels you want to measure noise on.
	</p>

<br>
	<h4>Output Interval</h4>
	<p>Enter the interval between measurements in seconds.</p>
	
<br>
	<h4>Measurement Bands</h4>
	<p>Select Octave or Third Octave bands and the band number of the highest band you wish to measure. Select the 
	number of decimators, which will in turn control the lowest frequency that the module measures noise at. 
	</p>
	
<br>
	<h4>Filters</h4>
	<p>Select Butterworth or IIR Filters. Generally, Butterworth filters will operate much faster than FIR filters on a 
	desktop computer. Generally 5th order Butterworth or 7th oder (128 tap) FIR filters are more than adequate. 
	The exact cut off frequencies and filter responses are shown for information only. 
	</p>
	
<br>
	<h4>Bode Plots</h4>
	<p>The filter responses and the responses of the decimators are shown in the Bode plot on the right
	hand side of the dialog. It is also possible to overlay the various ANSI standards. The scale of the 
	amplitude axis can be altered by double clicking on it.
