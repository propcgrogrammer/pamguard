<h2>Clip Bearings</h2>
<p>
Bearings will be automatically calculated to the sounds in clips if more than one channel of data is included.   
</p>

<p>Manual clip selection and many detectors may only have triggered on one channel. Therefore if you want multiple channels 
to be included in the clip it's essential that you select the appropriate Channel Selection in the settings
for each data trigger.</p>

<p>Bearings are calculated using a cross correlation method which can only estimate time delays between channels of 
up to about 200 samples. At a sample rate of 48kHz, this is equates to a hydrophone separation of around 8 m. 
If the hydrophones are more widely separated time delays and bearings will not be correctly calculated. 
We hope to rectify this in future releases.</p>

<p>Bearings to clips will be shown as lines on the <a href="../../../mapping/mapHelp/docs/overview.html">PAMGuard map</a>. 
The length of the lines can be adjusted from 
the Display Menu: Display/Clips Display Settings ... .</p>
