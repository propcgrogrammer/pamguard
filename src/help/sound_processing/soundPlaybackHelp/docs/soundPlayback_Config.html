<h1>Sound Output</h1>


<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>To access the module's settings, select <em><strong>Detection>Sound
Output... </strong></em> from the main menu . This will bring up the Sound Output
dialog.</p>


<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>The sound output module requires a source of raw data before it
can operate. Select a raw data source from the drop down list.</p>
<p>Select the data channels. Note that a sound card will only
be able to play back two channels at a time and you will therefore only
be able to check one or two boxes.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>The available options will depend on the type of sound acquisition
device.</p>

<h4>Sound Card and ASIO Sound Card Input</h4>
<p>If using a sound card input, you will only be able to play back out through a sound
card, and should ideally select the same device.</p><p>You will be restricted to two 
output channels. Once two channels are selected, other channels will be 'grayed out'. De-select
a channel in order to make a fresh selection.</p>

<h4>Other Input Devices</h4>
<p>If using other input devices, (National Instruments cards, SAIL Daq cards, etc.) you can
play back through any available device, though it is recommended that you use the same 
device if at all possible.</p><p>The sample rate of the output device does not need to match 
the input sample rate and PAMGuard will automatically up-sample or decimate data to convert between
the input sample rate and the output sample rate.</p>

<h4>Audio files and File Folders</h4>
<p>Select the output device type which can either be a sound card or a National Instruments device.</p>
<p>Set the output sample rate. This can be anything so long as it is supported by the output
device you are using.</p>
<p>Set the play-back speed. This is how many times real-time the data will play at.</p>
<p>PAMGuard will automatically up-sample or decimate data to convert between
the input sample rate and the output sample rate, taking into account the playback speed.</p>
<p>If listening on headphones via a sound card, then an output sample rate of 48kHz or 96kHz is recommended.
however, if you're outputting data from PAMGuard for other purposes, such as driving a high frequency sound 
source, then you will need to select an appropriately high sample rate and ensure that you are using an
output device that supports that sample rate.</p> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> During file analysis, if no channels are
selected and there is no play-back, analysis will continue at the maximum
rate possible using all available processor power. If sound play-back is
enabled, then analysis will proceed at the speed governed by the sound
play-back rate. If the processor can't keep up with analysing data at the
play-back rate, then play-back will appear interrupted and 'glitchy'</p>
<p>It is possible to re-configure channels during analysis, so if
you are analysing a lot of data, you may want to occasionally turn on
sound output on one or two channels to have a listen, then turn them off
again so that it processes as fast as possible.</p>
