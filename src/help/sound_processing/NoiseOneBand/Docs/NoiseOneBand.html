	<h1>Filtered Noise Measurement</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<br>

	<p>This module allows you to measure noise is a single band defined
		by a selection of filter types. As well as outputting several
		measurements at fixed time intervals it calculates cumulative sound
		exposure and also single pulse sound exposure for loud transients.</p>

	<h3>Creating the module</h3>
	<p>
		From the <em><strong>File>Add modules>Sound Processing</strong></em>
		menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select "<em><strong>Filtered
				Noise Measurement</strong></em>". Enter a name for the new module and press Ok.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Configuring the module</h3>
	<p>
		To configure the module, open the settings dialog from the <em><strong>Detection>"your
				module name" </strong></em> menu:

	<h4>Raw Data Source</h4>
	<p>
		Select a source of raw data. This will generally be a <a
			href="../../AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">
			Sound Acquisition Module</a> or the output of a <a
			href="../../decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">
			Decimator</a> if a lower frequency noise measurement is required. Check
		the channels you want to measure noise on.
	</p>

<br>
	<h4>Measurement Interval</h4>
	<p>Enter the interval between measurements in seconds and the
		interval for integrated sound exposure measurements.</p>

<br>
	<h4>Pulse Measurement</h4>
	<p>If your want to measure parameters from a single pulse, you
		should check the "Detect Pulses" box. Enter a pulse detection
		threshold and the maximum duration of a single pulse.</p>
	<p>If you are using pulse detection, the measurement interval
		should be relatively short compared to the pulse interval (e.g. 1s for
		piling or seismic). The pulse detection algorithm is very simple and
		just requires a jump in received amplitude from one measurement to the
		next that is greater than the Detection Threshold. The pulse will end
		when the measured levels drop to lower then the maximum measurement
		within the pulse minus the threshold. If a pulse continues for too
		long, it will be truncated when it reaches the Max Length. This should
		generally be set to be between the expected pulse length and the
		expected pulse interval.</p>

<br>
	<h4>Filter Design</h4>
	<p>A number of filter options are available. These are described in the 
	<a href="../../FiltersHelp/Docs/Filters_panel.html">Filter Design</a> section</p>
